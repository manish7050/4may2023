        <p>It is in the far northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, almost all of which Beijing insists falls under its sovereignty as "South Tibet".</p>
        <p>The Asian giants fought a war in 1962 over their 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) divide, now known as the Line of Actual Control, and it remains disputed to this day, with sporadic clashes and regular diplomatic manoeuvres.</p>
        <p>Culturally largely Tibetan, Arunachal Pradesh is savage territory for battle, with mountain passes as high as 4,750 metres (15,000 feet) still covered in snowdrifts as late as May, and thickly forested slopes lower down.</p>
        <p>Now both powers are engaged in major construction drives to reinforce their positions.

            <p>Days after Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir reignited their age-old rivalry with the infamous on-field altercation in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023, legendary all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has issued an eye-catching message for the 2011 World Cup winners. Former Indian skipper Kohli and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) mentor Gambhir traded personal insults after Faf du Plessis' Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) defeated KL Rahul's men in match No.42 of the IPL 2023 at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium on Monday.</p>
